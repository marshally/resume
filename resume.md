## Operations / Platform Engineering at Code Climate

> marshall@yountlabs.com

## Summary

I'm a scalability/distributed systems engineer who loves working on large scale, rapidly growing products that touch lives. I build top performing software teams and fine tune agile development processes.

I am currently at [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com). Our team builds distributed systems that **analyze 900 billion lines of source code** per day.

Before that I helped the #1 mobile _With Friends_ game series scale to **3,000 db writes per second** (100k Rails requests per second) and was the lead engineer at [broadcast.com](https://web.archive.org/web/19990427221707/http://broadcast.com/) when it was the biggest audio/video streaming site (and the **17th largest site by DAU**). I'm a co-organizer of the scalability-focused [Big Ruby Conference](http://bigrubyconf.com).

In my spare time, I am an amateur chef, lover of costume parties, and a licensed [**Pyrotechnic Special Effects Operator**](http://gov.texas.gov/film/production/laws_pyrotechnic) in the State of Texas.

## Outside of Work Projects

### Big Ruby Conference, co-organizer

[Big Ruby](http://bigrubyconf.com) is a conference focused on the use of Ruby in large organizations, infrastructures, userbases, and teams. If your Ruby runs hundreds of servers, handles millions of users, and you count each and every millisecond, this is the conference for you.

2013's videos received over 65K views on YouTube. In 2014 we had attendees from all over the world.

### Pyro Team Lead, Myschievia 2014

### The Ball of Light, Multimedia Software Lead
> February 2012 to August 2012

The [Ball of Light](http://www.theballoflight.com/) was an art project featured in the center of the 9 o'clock keyhole intersection during Burning Man 2012.

The Ball of Light is a 12 ft. diameter sphere composed of three interlocking aluminum rings, with **computer controlled DJ lights** mounted on the vertices. An **XBox Kinect controller** is mounted near eye level to allow users to interact with the lights, and a microphone mounted to the sculpture runs sound activated scripts. I created a set of **composable modular open source projects** that form the basis of the Ball of Light's interactivity.

### Dallas Ruby Brigade, Member
> November 2007 to Present

I've given several presentations to the Dallas Ruby Brigade including:

* _Microformats_ - April, 2010

### Grrwl
> April 2013 to May 2013

On-demand information to *any* mobile phone. Grrwl allows anyone in South Africa to **retrieve information for free by giving a "missed call" to a specific phone number, and receiving an SMS with the requested information**.

Grrwl can provide information services such as breaking news, transport schedules, sports scores, etc. Sending requested information over SMS means that we can reach 100% of the mobile phones in South Africa, as oppose to requiring a data-enabled phone. In future, we can provision "Grrwl lines" for brands and agencies, and create platforms for surveys and quizzes. By using the phone number as a user ID, we can build up user profiles from usage, and target advertising accordingly, and by avoiding spam / unsolicited messages, we can build user trust in a low-trust environment. A proof-of-concept has been built using Twilio and Heroku.

Update: Grrwl was sold in 2014.
